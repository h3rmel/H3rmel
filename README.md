# Isaac Hermel
### Senior Software Engineer | Distributed Systems & Product Engineering

Engineer focused on **High-Throughput Architectures** and **Scalable Frontend Systems**.  
Currently designing data ingestion pipelines processing **~59,000 records/minute** and optimizing Data Intensive Applications.

### 🏗️ Engineering Context & Architecture

I don't just use tools; I solve concurrency, latency, and scalability problems.

### 🚀 Proof of Work (Selected Projects)

#### [enterprise-react-architecture](https://github.com/h3rmel/enterprise-react-architecture)
> **Role:** Architect & Maintainer
> A reference implementation for mission-critical React applications.
> * **Problem:** Lack of standardization in testing strategies for complex UIs.
> * **Solution:** Implemented a **Shift-Left Testing** approach using Vitest and React Testing Library, enforcing TDD/BDD patterns to ensure zero-regression deployments.

#### [guarahooks](https://github.com/h3rmel/guarahooks)
> **Role:** Creator
>
> Headless logic library for React performance.
> * **Engineering:** Encapsulated complex state logic into type-safe hooks, reducing boilerplate and preventing unnecessary re-renders via advanced memoization patterns.

### 💼 Professional Impact

* **High-Volume ETL (Zenvia):** Maintaining ingestion pipelines handling **59k+ records/min** peak throughput across APIs and Airflow. Ensured data consistency for 5 distinct ERP integrations.
* **Operational Efficiency (Umbler):** Architected an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that reduced new engineer onboarding time by **50%**.
